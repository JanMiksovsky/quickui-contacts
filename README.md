This is a sample Contacts application created in QuickUI. It is intended to
demonstrate two things:

1. How to use QuickUI to create the UI for a non-trivial sample application.
2. How to use QuickUI as the View in an MVC/MVP application.

You can build this app with Grunt (https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) by running
"grunt" from the command line in this directory.
